# Sage: Book Recommendation Chatbot

Sage, the book recommendation chatbot, is a retrieval-based chatbot designed to recommend books based on user preferences, such as preferred author or book genre. The bot provides book-related details while interacting conversationally with users. The bot uses natural language processing (NLP) models, libraries, and a predefined book dataset from GoodReads.com to provide intelligent and personalized recommendations.
